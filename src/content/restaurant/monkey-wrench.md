## The Ambiance

Located in the heart of downtown Salt Lake City, Monkeywrench is a delightful little vegan ice cream shop full of light and charm. It's a walk-up style place with no indoor seating, but the bright and inviting space makes you want to linger.

## The Menu

The star of the show is their incredible selection of housemade, plant-based ice cream flavors. From classics like chocolate and vanilla to unique offerings like lavender and banana brownie, there's something to satisfy every craving. The ice cream is luxuriously creamy, made from a base of coconut milk or cashews.

Even non-vegans rave about the taste and texture. As one reviewer put it, "you always taste the coconut milk, you have to like that." But for those who do, it's pure heaven.

### The Verdict

For anyone with dietary restrictions like lactose intolerance or nut allergies, Monkeywrench is a godsend. No more settling for bland fruit sorbets! The staff is knowledgeable about ingredients and cross-contamination risks.

And for those without restrictions, it's simply some of the best ice cream around, vegan or not. Creamy, rich, and bursting with creative flavors, a visit to Monkeywrench is a must for any dessert lover in Salt Lake City. Just be prepared for it to be a walk-up experience without indoor seating on chilly days.

> Pro tip: Don't miss the seasonal flavors like peach cobbler and gingerbread cookie dough. They're out of this world!
